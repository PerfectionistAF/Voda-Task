## Overview

This is a task mainly focusing on coding an Angular frontend for a Nodejs backend. We were provided with a weather-cities.json file and another index.js file. The goal is to work on a weather api. Main requirements include listing the cities, displaying city weather cards by date, searching for a city by name.
